# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Purpose:


The purpose of this project is to use Javascript, Plotly, Bootstrap and D3.js to build an interactive dashboard that visualizes the diversity of bacterial cultures that thrive in the human navel. The deliverables requested are as follows:

 * Create a Horizontal Bar Chart
 * Create a Bubble Chart
 * Create a Gauge Chart
 * Customize the Dashboard
 * Deploy the Dashboard webpage on GitHub Pages

 * The samples.json dataset was provided by research conducted at the NC State-The Public Science Lab/Your Wild Life Projects (D. Fergus and    S.Council)[Dataset link](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/). The json file contains Demographic information on the research subjects, belly button washing frequency, belly button type, the OTU's (operational taxonomic units) assigned to the various bacterial cultures along with the concentration values per sample.  
 
 * VS Code was used to write Javascript Code, charts.js and index.html.

Below is a graphic pulled from the NC State-The Public Science Lab website that depicts the cultures being studied.
